🧩 What is the Advanced Workpool Pattern?

The Advanced Workpool Pattern is a way to run multiple tasks concurrently while controlling how many goroutines run at the same time.
Instead of creating a new goroutine for every task (which can overload the system), we create a fixed number of workers that keep picking up jobs from a shared queue until all work is done.

⚙️ Why is it useful?

It helps you:

Avoid too many goroutines — by keeping the number of active workers limited.

Use system resources efficiently — all workers stay busy until every task is complete.

Speed up execution — tasks are processed in parallel instead of one by one.

Handle errors and cancellations gracefully — workers can stop when a context is cancelled or when the job queue is empty.

💡 Example (in simple words)

Imagine you have a list of items and you want to copy or process each one.
If you do this in a single loop, each item is handled one after another — this is sequential and takes longer.

With a workpool, you can create, say, 5 workers.
Each worker will take an item from the list, process it, and then pick the next available one.
This means multiple items are being processed at the same time, which makes the program faster and more efficient.


without this pattern time complexity is -> o(n*t)  t is proccessing time
with this pattern time complexity is -> o(n*t/w) w is the number of workers
